Erganism is a webapp which enables networks of creators to intersubjectively co-create evolving ecosystems of anything (e.g. art) while being fairly remunerated for their contributions in a dynamic and adaptable manner, fueling the process of co-creation rather than the extraction of speculators. 

This repo contains Royalty Manager smart contract that implements logic for purchasing licenses on artworks, keeps track of artist's accounts and allows them to withdraw their earnings.

The app relies on Ethereum Attestation Service to keep track of on-chain attestations and relations of aritis's artowrks to each other

Smart contract is deployed on Sepolia:
